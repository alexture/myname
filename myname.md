Hi, I’m Alex!

You may have known me earlier as Lexane.

# My identity

My name is **Alexandre**, commonly shortened as **Alex**. In English, I use **he/him and they/them** pronouns, which means you can use the one you like the most. In French, I use the pronoun **il**, which is the classic masculine pronoun. In other gendered languages, please also refer to me with "masculine" pronouns, unless gender-neutral pronouns exist, in which case use either!

# I have questions!

First of all, a **disclaimer**: my journey & thoughts are just mine, and I can’t speak in the name of everyone who changes their name & pronouns. I like to share information, but I don’t have a universal Truth to share with you!

Second, please do **message me** if you have any question that’s not covered here (I’m assuming that if you’re reading this post, you know how to contact me). I appreciate curiosity and will answer most questions!

## I’m scared I’ll get your name and/or pronouns wrong!

It happens, and that’s fine; but please try your best!

There are [many posts on the Internet with tips to get this right](https://theyismypronoun.wordpress.com/2014/04/26/tips-on-training-yourself-to-change-pronouns-for-someone-you-care-about-or-anyone-really/).

## How did you know you were trans?

I’d like to tell you "I’ve always known", but that’s not true. Around the beginning of 2020, I started questioning some things, without questioning my gender at all; I was more thinking I wanted to "look more masculine", but thought of it only as an aesthetic change. For example, that’s when I started cutting my hair shorter and shorter.

In the first half of 2021, I thought more about some things that had been going through my mind, and started linking them to gender. My girlfriend, who I cannot thank enough, asked me if I’d like her to try calling me Alex and using neutral or masculine pronouns with me. We tried for one week-end; at the end of these few days, I felt amazing and asked her to keep going.

During the second half of 2021, I slowly extended this to most of my relationships. By now, I’d say 90% of my friends are aware of my identity (with my very conservative family a notable exception). Every time someone uses my chosen name and pronouns, I feel wonderful - and with getting used to this, every time someone genders me in the feminine form, I feel worse than the previous time, which is a pretty clear sign that it needs to stop happening.

In December 2021, I made the switch at work and on most Internet places, except for some highly public-facing ones, as I do not wish to talk about it to my family at this time.

## Is your physical appearance going to change?

Probably, although not on the short term. I am looking into taking voice coaching lessons for a lower, more "masculine" voice.

I am aiming for top (ie. chest) surgery, but not before end of 2022 at the very earliest. As of now, I do not plan on taking testosterone before this surgery.

## What do I do if I see your old name somewhere?

Please tell me: I might want to update it, and if I don’t I’ll add it to my "change this later" list.

## How can I support you?

Hey, thanks, that’s a really nice thing to ask!

* Use the right pronouns and name for me
* Correct people if they get it wrong, whether I’m here or not to hear it. If I’m not, nobody other than you can help; if I am, it’s nice to have someone do it for me and save me the effort and awkwardness. Don’t make it a big deal - personally, I usually just say "they" when someone gets it wrong, and move on.
* Understand that this is a very stressful process, so if you can make my life easier, feel free to do so. (Although honestly, if you can make anyone’s life easier, do it, regardless of gender.)
* Don’t treat me differently! I’m still the same person, I like the same things as I did, and as far as I know, my personality hasn’t magically changed either :)
